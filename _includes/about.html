    <p class="about__text"> I've been working for the web since almost 5 years now including some time working in house in a web agency in London for a year.
      Before I discovered the Web I worked for small and not so small organisations between Switzerland and East Africa. And long before that I graduated from university with a masters degree in Contemporary Swiss history. (Which that can be useful, if you play a history board game. Maybe.)
      A couple of years ago we swapped our flat in London with a hundred years old sailing barge (video) in the Netherlands where we live now and from where I work with businesses and organisations from all over Europe.
      Beside Swiss German, I speak fluent english, my dutch is getting better every day and I also understand french. Plus I can timber wooden draws so they fit into non rectancular areas (Of which there are a lot on a barge).
      I love creating delightful and engaging experiences for the web, solving complex technical problems and creating products which make people happy. So I'm pretty pleased with my job. If you have a project in mind you think I can help you with, I'm happy to year from you! </p>
